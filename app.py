"""
This is a Streamlit app that allows users to upload a PDF file and ask a question
about its content. The app uses the PyPDF2 library to extract text from the PDF file,
and then uses OpenAI embeddings to create a knowledge base of the text. Users can then
ask a question about the text, and the app uses a question-answering chain to find
the most relevant answer from the knowledge base.

To run the app, simply run this script in a Python environment with the required
dependencies installed, and then navigate to the local URL provided by Streamlit.
